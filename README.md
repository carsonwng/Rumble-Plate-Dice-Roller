# Rumble-Plate-Dice-Roller
A switch adapted device to roll the dice for any game night!

This switch activated dice roller utilizes a hobby motor, battery holder, Omron switch, and 3.5mm jack along with a couple 3d printed parts and a clear plastic cup to make any dice game more accessible. This device is a new development of the Dice Spinner that features faster dice rolling and variations in allowable cup size. With an additional few prints, the dice roller itself can become the switch button, while still allowing for use of a separate AT switch.

The Rumble Plate Dice Roller allows for approximately 10oz to 22oz clear plastic cups. Following the assembly guide, the components can be wired and mounted, then the dice roller is all ready to use! It is an easy toy to make that allows people to roll the dice in an alternative way.
